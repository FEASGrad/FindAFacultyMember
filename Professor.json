This safety needs to be mathematically proven, but no control algorithm can operate effectively without appropriate knowledge of the physical environment. As such, perception algorithms and artificial intelligence need to identify safe and unsafe zones, find vehicle trajectories and predict the upcoming actions of nearby vehicles and pedestrians.\n\nSolution: We are exploring real-time perception and control algorithms to enable collision-free motion control of autonomous vehicles on both the ground and in the air. We use a combination of ready-to- deploy software solutions in C++, PX4 and ROS, as well as new vehicle concepts tailored for specific applications, including morphing structures and thrust vectoring propulsion.\n\nImpact: Smarter autonomous vehicles are safer autonomous vehicles. Our work will contribute to the increased adoption of autonomous vehicle technology that is safe and sustainable, with vehicles that can better communicate and navigate the world, preventing collisions, creating robust transportation systems and increasing energy efficiency."
